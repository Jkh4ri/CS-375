For this week, our group is meeting with our stakeholders and writing up the software requirements report. I worked on coming up with when we would work on specific areas of our project. Setting up the AI integration, the game loop, voting system, etc. Basically mapping out our timeline on how long each part would take and their difficulty. We are going to use this information to set up our Gantt chart in our report.
